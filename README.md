# Greedy-Best-First-Search
The concept behind Greedy Best First Search is to perform an evaluation function to determine which nearby is most promising and then explore it. It checks from the current node which of the neighbors has the lowest heuristic and then explores it. Best first search uses the concept of a priority queue and heuristic search.
